Security Considerations
-----------------------

Frontends register to the Factory using HTCondor supported security mechanisms. The current supported authorization and authentication method is GSI based. A registered frontend is granted access to write requests in the form of HTCondor Classads to the Factory Collector. The factory receives submit credentials from the frontend through encrypted HTCondor classads; the factory can impersonate the identities from the frontend. The factory submits on a Frontendâ€™s behalf to Compute Entrypoints using either GSI or SciTokens.
